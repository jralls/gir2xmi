Need to visualize a GObject-based class structure? If you have your
project set up to use gobject-introspection, you can create a UML
model in XMI from it, ready to import into ArgoUML or KDE's Umbrello.

You'll need the two perl files from this repository, gir2xmi and ObjectRef.pm.

You'll also need the following dependencies from CPAN:

XML::LibXML
Getopt::Long
Pod::Usage
Data::Dumper
File::Spec::Functions
Digest::MD5

Of course, you may already have these installed.

The program is documented with POD, so you can say "perldoc gir2xmi"
or "gir2xmi -man" to read the documentation.
